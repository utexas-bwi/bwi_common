# BWI Person Detection

Person detection using pcl\_people module. Modified from [this example](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/ground\_based\_rgbd\_people\_detection.php). Original repo at [here](https://github.com/Marcus-Zhu/bwi_pcl_detection).

## Launch Files

+ calibrate\_v2.launch: calibration launch file for segbot V2. Launch before person detection. Calibration file will be generated containing ground coefficients.  
+ person\_detection\_v2.launch: run person detection node and record person position.  
+ person\_detection\_v2\_norecord.launch: run person detection node without logging.


+ calibrate\_v3.launch: calibration launch file for segbot V3. Launch before person detection. Calibration file will be generated containing ground coefficients.  
+ person\_detection\_v3.launch: run person detection node and record person position.  
+ person\_detection\_v3\_norecord.launch: run person detection node without logging.

+ pcl\_detector/human\_clouds: sensor\_msgs/PointCloud2

## Visualize

Run `python scripts/visualization.py` to obtain a 2d heatmap using data from `data/record.txt`.

#### Usage Example

1. `roslaunch person\_detector calibrate\_v2.launch` and follow the instruction to click 3 points on the ground.
2. `roslaunch person\_detector person\_detection\_v2.launch` to run person detection node. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop.
3. `python dir/to/package/scripts/visualization.py` to generate a heatmap from recorded data.

## Customization

Topic names, calibration file and log file can be changed in launch file.
